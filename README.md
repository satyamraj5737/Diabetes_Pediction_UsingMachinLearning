#Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes based on certain diagnostic measures using machine learning techniques. We employ the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier provided by scikit-learn to build our predictive model.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on Kaggle. This dataset contains diagnostic information for females of Pima Indian heritage. It includes attributes such as blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, etc., along with the target variable indicating diabetes onset.
